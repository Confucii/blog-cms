# Blog CMS

This project is a comprehensive blogging system consisting of three main parts: a RESTful API, a client-side application, and a content management system (CMS) for administrators. It allows admins to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, submit comments, and manage blog content efficiently.

## Description

The Blog CMS is specifically designed for administrators to efficiently manage the blog's content. It's also built using React.js and offers the following functionalities:

#### User Authentication:

To access the CMS, administrators must provide the correct credentials via a login form. Authentication data is received with cookies, granting access to admin privileges.

#### Context Management:

The CMS employs React's Context API to make authentication data accessible throughout the component tree, ensuring access to administrative functions.

#### Custom Hooks:

To prevent code repetition and streamline codebase maintenance, custom hooks are implemented. One such hook is used to access and update authentication data.

#### Axios Integration:

Axios is used to interact with the API. A custom hook exposes Axios with response and request interceptors, removing code repetition for every call.

#### Content Management:

Administrators can perform various content management actions, including hiding and showing posts, deleting posts, creating new posts, editing existing posts, and deleting comments. A form is provided for creating and editing posts.
